# Default Server List for podget
#
# FORMAT:    <url> <category> <name>
#
# NOTES:
#    1. URL Rules:
#      A. Any spaces in the URL need to be converted to %20
#    2. Category Rules:
#      A.  Must be one word without spaces.
#      B.  You may use underscores and dashes.
#      C.  You can insert date substitutions.
#          %YY%  ==  Year
#          %MM%  ==  Month
#          %DD%  ==  Day
#    3. Name Rules:
#      A.  If you are creating ASX playlists, make sure the feed name does not
#          have any spaces in it and the filename cannot be blank.
#      B.  You can leave the feed name blank, and files will be saved in the
#          category directory.
#      C.  Names with spaces are only compatible with filesystems that allow for spaces
#          in filenames.  For example, spaces in feed names are OK for feeds saved to
#          Linux ext partitions but are not OK for those saved to Microsoft FAT partitions.
#    4. Disable the downloading of any feed by commenting it out with a leading #.
#
# Examples:
#   http://www.lugradio.org/episodes.rss Linux LUG Radio
#
# Example with date substitution in the category and a blank feed name:
#   http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/downloadtrial/worldservice/summary/rss.xml News-%YY%-%MM%-%DD%
#
# Example of two ways to do a feed with authentication:
#   http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name USER:username PASS:password
#     OR
#   http://username:password@somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name
#
#   NOTE:   The second method will fail if a colon (:) is part of the username or password.
#           Both methods will fail if a space is part of the username or password.
#
# Additional Options:
#   OPT_CONTENT_DISPOSITION     - Attempt to get filename from the Content-Disposition tag that is part of
#                                 wget --server-response.
#   OPT_DISPOSITION_FAIL        - This option works in conjunction with OPT_CONTENT_DISPOSITION by removing
#                                 any URLs that fail to receive a filename from the COMPLETED log.  This allows
#                                 them to be automatically retried the next time a session runs.  If this option
#                                 is added to a feed that has already been downloaded then the user will need to
#                                 remove the URLs for the problematic files from the COMPLETED log manually. On
#                                 one feed this allowed for the improvement of the number of filename problems from
#                                 approximately 15% to under 2% over the course of 6 sessions.  Those sessions can
#                                 occur sequentially on one day or as part of your established cron rotation.
#   OPT_FILENAME_LOCATION       - Some feeds do not have the detailed filename listed in the FEED but rather rename
#                                 the file on redirection.  This option address that issue by attempting to grab the
#                                 filename from the last 'Location:' tag in the output of 'wget --server-response'.
#   OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_MDATE   - For feeds that use a singular filename for each item that is identified by a long
#                                 somewhat incomprehensible string in the URL.  These feeds were previously fixed
#                                 with FILENAME_FORMATFIX4 which would append the string to the common filename to
#                                 produce unique filenames for each item.  However this produced filenames that were
#                                 not very easy to understand.  This option gives us another method for dealing with
#                                 these common filenames.  This appends the date of the files last change (modification
#                                 date) as a prefix to the filename in the format of YYYYMMDD_HHhMMm_<common-part>.  This
#                                 makes the filenames sortable and gives the user something that makes a moderate amount
#                                 of sense.  Does not work for all feeds, for some feeds the last modification time for
#                                 each file is the time of download.  Which may be acceptable in some situations but can
#                                 cause confusion when downloading more than one item at a time from a feed.
#
# Note:  It is possible to use more than one option per feed, this will combine the effects of the options in order from
#        top to bottom as they are listed here.
#
# Examples:
#   http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_CONTENT_DISPOSITION
#   http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_CONTENT_DISPOSITION OPT_DISPOSITION_FAIL
#   http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_FILENAME_LOCATION
#   http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_MDATE
#   http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_FILENAME_LOCATION OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_MDATE
#
# Atom Feed Options:  The following options are available for advanced handling of Atom feeds.
#   ATOM_FILTER_SIMPLE            This option will enable filtering for just audio or video files from a feed.
#   ATOM_FILTER_TYPE="type"       This option allows more detailed filtering of the variety of types available.  This can
#                                 limit the files downloaded to one type (example:  "audio/mpeg") or to a few types
#                                 (example: "(audio|video)/.*" for all audio and video types, OR "audio/.*" for all audio
#                                 types).
#   ATOM_FILTER_LANG="language"   If an Atom feed supports multiple languages for enclosures, then you can use this
#                                 option to filter to only those you desire.  You can limit to one language (example: "en"
#                                 for just English) or combine several supported languages to get them all (example: "(en|es|fr)"
#                                 to download files in English, Spanish and French.  How the languages are defined may vary
#                                 from feed to feed.
#
# Note: If you do not enable ANY of the ATOM_FILTER options, when you run podget with "-vv" or higher, for every Atom feed
#       that supports multiple enclosures per item, Podget will tell you with the count per type or language to help you decide if
#       you should use the filters to reduce the quantity of your downloads.
#
# Examples:
#   http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name ATOM_FILTER_SIMPLE
#   http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name ATOM_FILTER_TYPE="audio/mpeg"
#   http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name ATOM_FILTER_TYPE="audio/.*"
#   http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name ATOM_FILTER_TYPE="(audio|video)/.*"
#   http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name ATOM_FILTER_LANG="en"
#   http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name ATOM_FILTER_LANG="(en|es|fr)"
#   http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name ATOM_FILTER_TYPE="audio/mpeg" ATOM_FILTER_LANG="en"
